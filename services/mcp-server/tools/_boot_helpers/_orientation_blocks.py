"""Orientation blocks for the boot briefing card.

Renders the operator-approved "Dispatch & Consult" capability-axis block and
the co-located "Liveness" block, emitted ABOVE the skills list by
``render_briefing_card()``.

This module is the DURABLE HOME for the liveness content
(``todo:dispatch-surface-orientation-fix`` Part 2 / 2a). It deliberately lives
in renderer SOURCE rather than a rendered ``operational-context-*.md``, because
``render_operational_context`` recomposes that file on every boot and clobbers
manual edits (assertion 11520). Renderer source survives the next boot.

Block text is operator-approved (2026-05-31); the grok model string is
``xai/grok-4.3`` per operator. Spec:
``cortex:notes/system/threads/part2-cortex-boot-capability-axis-handoff.md`` and
``claude-web-dispatch-decision-table.md`` §4.

# Surface-aware Dispatch & Consult blocks (operator-approved override 2026-06-01,
# thread 1167). frontier_dispatch/team_dispatch are PRIMARY/direct-call on BOTH
# surfaces after the standalone-domain re-land (thread 1146/1167):
#
#   - claude /mcp (mcp, mcp_claude): canonical.yaml now declares standalone
#     `frontier_dispatch`/`team_dispatch` DOMAINS (visibility mcp/mcp_claude), so
#     their tool_name enters _PRIMARY_TOOLS in _derive.derive_claude_manifest —
#     direct call, no dispatch step. (advisor/pipeline_consult are NOT promoted
#     → still OVERFLOW via dispatch(tool="…"). agent_consult removed 2026-06.)
#   - grok /mcp/grok (mcp_grok): _derive.derive_grok_manifest emits a FLAT
#     manifest where dispatch_frontier/dispatch_team are standalone tools — direct
#     call as well. The grok-serving dispatch_* entries no longer carry mcp_claude
#     (stripped in the re-land) so grok stays flat.
#
# NOTE: `cache_priority` in canonical.yaml is INERT (not consumed by derivation,
# per _derive.py). The lever that makes these primary on claude is the standalone
# DOMAIN, and it MUST stay committed — an uncommitted change reverts on rebuild
# (the Part-1 regression, 11528/11549). Source of truth: decision-table §2/§3/§4.

  1. WHICH substrate?   2. Did its LOAD EVENT fire?   3. What does the LIVE PROBE say?
